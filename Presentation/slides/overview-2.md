##  What does Docker do?

Docker packages any application in any language using any toolchain into a container.
This container can be deployed anywhere and it will run exactly the same.

note:
With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

The container can be handed off to operations or a 3rd party hosting provider and ran. All containers look the same from the outside.
